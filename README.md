# HEART-DISEASE-PREDICTION

# Introduction
This project aims to showcase the process of data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and making predictions using various classification algorithms. The dataset used in this project is related to heart disease diagnosis. The code provided demonstrates how to:

- Load and preprocess the dataset
- Handle categorical and continuous features
- Train and evaluate several classification models
- Save and load trained models
- Make predictions using the trained models

- install Jupyter Notebook.

# Dataset Used
Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

The dataset has 14 attributes:

- age: age in years.
- sex: sex (1 = male; 0 = female).
- cp: chest pain type (Value 0: typical angina; Value 1: atypical angina; Value 2: non-anginal pain; Value 3: asymptomatic).
- trestbps: resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.
- chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl.
- fbs: fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).
- restecg: resting electrocardiographic results (Value 0: normal; Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality; Value 2: probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).
- thalach: maximum heart rate achieved.
-  exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no).
- oldpeak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
- slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 0: upsloping; Value 1: flat; Value 2: downsloping).
- ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.
- thal: thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect).
- target: heart disease (1 = no, 2 = yes).
